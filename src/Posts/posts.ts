          There are often two problems a developer faces when working on side projects. First is that
          they are too precious of their work. Everything needs to be done "right" and thus they
          usually make very little progress with the limited time that they have. Secondly more
          often than not developers have too many ideas that they want to work on. 
          The combination of these two things leads to a Github page half completed projects. 
          I can confidently say most developers have had to go through their Github page
          and delete a bunch of repos that had no actual meaning or purpose.

          Doing things "right" is a broad term that can manifest in many ways. Maybe your following TDD and trying
          to get 100% test coverage, using all the hottest new JS frameworks, or writing your app in the
          fanciest of FP languages. There is only so much free time in a day and if the primary goal
          of your project is to do it the "right" way that's totally valid, but this will greatly 
          decrease the speed of your output.

          Frequency of output can lead to an apthaty towards your side project. We live in a time where
          instant gratification is a like or one click buy away. Developers by nature find problems in
          their enviroment and try to solve them. This tends to lead to a laundry list of project ideas
          written down in your notebook or saved in a list on your phone. When that apathy towards
          your current project kicks in it's really easy to move onto the next thing.

          At this point I want to be clear. There is nothing at all wrong with doing things the "right" way
          or having a laundy list of ideas. It's all about managment of these two competing sides of your brain.

          Pick small increments of MVPs that you can ship. If you're trying to learn a new language and don't
          want to do a todo list maybe try to make a Twitter, Reddit, or Youtube clone. If you're working on 
          a more ambitious project choose one vertical slice that can be shipped in a week and go to town.
          This allows you to both figure out what technologies you enjoy / are productive working with while
          also finding which projects on your todo list are fun and feasible. If after you've shipped
          your first vertical slice and feel inspired you can always find another vertical slice to work on.

          Take this website for example. At the time of writing this blog post, April 2020, I'm writing this in
          a json blob because Markdown support isn't implement, I don't have a backend CMS, and the idea of learning
          Gatsby seemed to take it ouf the scope of the time I hade allotted. But I know I will eventually get to
          these things. Neglecting these things however has allowed me to focus on making a quick down and dirty webpage,
          building out content types I want to use, and generate a laundry list of things I can eventually flesh out. 
          If and when I choose to, but for now I've shipped this and plan to move onto a new project next week.
